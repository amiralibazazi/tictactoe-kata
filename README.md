You shouldn't need instructions, if you don't recognise how to play just from running the game then I've designed it poorly and you should let me know.

Things that need to be done that I'm aware of:

  -MultiplayerGameEngine doesnt do anything yet, it's only single player for now;
  
  -ComputerPlayer doesnt have an AI yet that plays the board. The board will seemingly print twice after each player turn as a result due to the empty computer turn.
  
  -X and O markers are still primitive values that need to be encapsulated
